# Debezium
Debezium is a distributed platform that captures row-level changes in databases and streams them as events to Apache Kafka, enabling applications to react to these changes in real-time. It acts as a change data capture (CDC) solution by monitoring database transaction logs (or equivalent) and transforming these changes into structured events that can be consumed by other system
