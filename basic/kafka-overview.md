### Introduction

Modern systems rarely function in isolation. They continuously communicate with other services, systems, or external parties to exchange information or respond to incoming data. This exchange can involve various types of information, such as pings, messages, or events. The way a system reacts to this information often depends on its nature and criticality.

For example:

* **Critical Information:** Financial transactions (e.g., a customer swiping a card at a store)
* **Event-based Information:** Traffic violations detected by a surveillance camera
* **Alert Information:** Fire detected by a surveillance system, triggering an automatic fire response

To efficiently handle these diverse types of data, systems categorize them as **events**, **messages**, or **general information**. The classification determines how the system processes and responds to the data.

### From Monolithic to Distributed Systems

Earlier, systems were built as **monolithic architectures**, where all components were tightly coupled. Communication between systems mainly occurred via **REST** or **SOAP** protocols. While simple, these protocols had significant limitations:

* Limited fault tolerance: If the main system failed, all incoming messages were lost.
* Lack of durability: Messages were not preserved if the system was unavailable.
* Tight coupling: Failure in one part could disrupt the entire system.

### Introduction of Message Queues

To address these issues, **Message Queues** were introduced. These queues act as independent systems that receive and store messages, allowing downstream services to consume them at their own pace. Key advantages include:

* **Durability:** Messages remain in the queue even if the consumer is temporarily unavailable.
* **Decoupling:** Producers and consumers operate independently, improving system reliability.
* **Acknowledgment:** Messages are only removed from the queue once consumed and acknowledged.

However, a new challenge emerged: what if downstream systems needed to consume the same message multiple times?

### Kafka: A Robust Solution

**Apache Kafka** addresses this challenge by enabling multiple consumers to access the same message as many times as needed. Kafka’s architecture is inherently distributed, comprising:

* **Kafka Cluster:** A group of Kafka brokers working together.
* **Kafka Broker:** An individual Kafka server responsible for handling producer and consumer requests.
* **Topics and Partitions:** Messages are stored in **topics**, which are further divided into **partitions** for scalability and redundancy.

Kafka’s **replication factor** ensures fault tolerance by distributing messages across multiple brokers. This architecture ensures that if one broker fails, others can take over seamlessly. Kafka's ability to store messages in a fault-tolerant, durable way makes it highly resilient and reliable.

### Kafka Terminology


* Clusters: Group of Kafka brokers working together for scalability and fault tolerance (e.g., Netflix’s global streaming architecture).
* Brokers: Individual Kafka servers that handle message read/write requests (e.g., one node in a Kafka cluster).

* Topics: Named channels where messages are categorized (e.g., "payment_transactions" or "fire_alerts").

* Producers: Services that publish messages to Kafka topics (e.g., traffic cameras sending violation data).

* Consumers: Services that read messages from Kafka topics (e.g., billing systems processing card swipes).

* Consumer Groups: Sets of consumers that share the load for a topic (e.g., multiple servers processing fraud alerts).

* Partitions: Subdivisions within a topic for parallel processing and scalability (e.g., breaking "sales_events" into regions).

* Replication Factor: Number of copies for each partition to ensure durability (e.g., replication factor of 3 for critical alerts).

* Partition Leader: The broker responsible for managing read/write for a specific partition (e.g., main server for a partition).

* Acknowledgement (acks): Confirmation settings for message delivery (e.g., "acks=all" for maximum durability).

### Kafka Optimization Factors
The Kafka Optimization Theorem essentially captures the trade-off between latency, durability, and throughput in Kafka. It states that you can optimize for two of these factors, but not all three simultaneously, without compromising on at least one.

1. Latency
2. Throughput
3. Durability
4. Availability
